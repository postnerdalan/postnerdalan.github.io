                <p>
			Institutions like governments and research institutes
			often try to sell their solutions to the general public
			by employing buzz-words like <b>disruptive
			technology</b> or <b>innovation</b> to encourage the
			adaptation of a new way of doing things. Often, this is
			<em>not</em> what actual businesses and consumers
			want&mdash;buying a used car that works well is a
			perfectly adequate solution to the general problem of
			<em>comfortable and affordable transportation</em>.
			Choosing a tried-and-true make and model as opposed to
			a fancy new electric vehicle is a robust solution that
			can be serviced/maintained by non-specialists all over
			the country (here, we write from the USA).
		</p>
		<p>
			At Postnerd, we take a similar approach to the
			"reliable used car" philosophy with respect to
			information technology.  We offer solutions based on
			tried and true software and development techniques so
			that our team can consistently deliver what we promise.
			We develop tech stacks that do use industry-tested
			technologies and focus on maintainability over
			premature optimizations.  We don't shy away from newer
			approaches if they've been proven to work in the same
			way that one might install a new air conditioning
			system on a house built with robust, time-tested
			building methods.

		<p>
		    In 2021, you're going to hear a lot of talk about "building
		    back better" and how our economy has been "transformed".
		    Talk of the future is chatter of robots, refrigerators that
		    spy on you, and people in suits that stare at monitors who
		    are supposed to be protecting you (but don't mind getting
		    paid a lot to do so).

                    At Postnerd, we believe that you do not need to become drones
		    to defeat the drones&mdash;rather, we recognize that it is human
		    labor that makes or breaks great products and services.

                    The year 2020 shook many people into realizing that the "normal"
                    of yesteryear is not stable and that we should expect big changes
                    across all sectors of society in terms of how we organize living
                    spaces, labor, and resources.
                    Here at Postnerd we are motivated to not passively wait
                    as the future "happens" to us. Specifically, we are working on
                    solutions to offer <em>alternatives</em> to things like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="evil">automation</span> when unneeded&mdash;e.g. phone robots when people do better
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="evil">artificial intelligence</span>&mdash;the complex fabric of life is not a
                        mechanical chessboard!</li>
                    <li><span class="evil">overseas outsourcing</span>&mdash;when possible, we should try to work with
                        those around us rather than cutting costs and destroying communities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While big tech and large corporate solutions can offer
                    deliver slick, "one size fits all" kinds of projects, this
                    is often done in the manner of the <b>Bed of Procrustes</b>&mdash;adjusting
                    the customer to the shape of the project, rather than
                    the other way around! Its no wonder the kids' heads are shrinking.

                    back to the front and leverage existing tech products to
                    design robust, easily maintainable systems that make nerds
                    elsewhere manage the small, costly details and research and
                    development of platforms we <em>don't</em> control.

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    Postnerd is a "lean startup" aiming at providing low cost, low
                    maintenance technology solutions to people who share similar
                    concerns with us about the societal effects of the
                    spread of digital technologies. We seek to empower our customers
                    by showing them how they can use technologies to work for them
                    <em>without</em> expensive contracts, privacy invasive marketing
                    schemes, or over-paying nerds to try to describe people with
                    numbers in databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our name "postnerd" means "after (being a) nerd"&mdash;by
                    training, many tech professionals are taught to be highly
                    specialized, interchangeable parts. Our philosophy is the
                    opposite&mdash;we recognize the uniqueness of each individual
                    and how <b>custom solutions</b> using <b>common and easy to use tools</b> are often
                    the most cost-effective solutions for actually getting things
                    done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created postnerd to <em>do something</em> about
                    some disturbing trends that really got going in the twenty-first
                    century. Specifically, the arrival of the smartphone has ushered
                    in an un-precedented era of centralized control and surveillance
                    with the decisions of very small, un-elected groups of people
                    exercising massive influence (and thus control through subtle
                    suggestion) of millions of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not "anti-technology". As can be seen below, we make
                    use of social media, sites like those in the links below.
                    To the contrary, we strive to <em>extract maximum value</em> from
                    those services freely offered to us. We aren't zealots for
                    anonymity or privacy&mdash;ID verification has its place in
                    society. On the other hand, we don't believe you should ask
                    for and retain information longer than is needed to conduct
                    honest business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We look forward to getting in touch with you!
